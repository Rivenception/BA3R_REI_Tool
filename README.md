Uconn Bootcamp Project One: REI Tool


As the first project for the Uconn Coding Bootcamp our team is setting out to build a tool for real estate investors and average homebuyers to get information and compare to the current market to make educated purchasing decisions for the user.

## User Story

```
AS AN potential homebuyer
I WANT an app that displays relevant information to purchasing a property
SO THAT I can make an educated decision on whether the property is financially affordable
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN an MLS number
WHEN I click the button to generate data
THEN I am presented with a series of information for the following:

	- Similar listings homes for sale prices and specs
	- School listings and ratings for the area
	- Similar properties sold within a 5 mile radius
	- Similar rental listings
```
